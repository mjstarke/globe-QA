All figures should be named according to the format:

    SCRIPT_DATES_REGION_SOURCE_TYPE_DESCRIPTION.png

and should have titles formatted according to:

    DATES / REGION / SOURCE
    LONG_DESCRIPTION

Each variable should be separated from others by underscores, but should not themselves contain underscores - that is,
    filename.split("_")
should return a tuple corresponding to (SCRIPT, DATES, REGION, SOURCE, TYPE, DESCRIPTION).

Variables have the following meanings:

    SCRIPT is a reference to the script that created the image.  For instance, S007 refers to figure_S007.py.  Examples:
        S001
        S002
        ...

    DATES is the range of dates for which the figure is valid.  The start date need not include the day unless the range
    does not begin on the first of that month, and the end date need not include the day unless the range does not end
    on the last day of that month.  Months should be given by 3-letter abbreviations.  Examples:
        Jan2017-May2019
        Dec2017-Jan2018
        01Aug2016-05Aug2016
        Jun2018-Jul2018minusDec2017-Jan2018    (difference between timeframes)

    REGION is the geographic area for which the figure is valid.  Examples:
        global
        CONUS-Europe-MiddleEast
        none

    SOURCE is the source of the data presented in the figure.  Examples:
        GLOBE-SC                         (sky conditions)
        GLOBE-LC-MHM-TH                  (land covers, mosquito habitat mapper, and tree heights)
        GLOBEvGEOS                       (GLOBE compared to GEOS)
        GLOBEvGEOSvAquaTerravHIMWARI-8   (GLOBE, GEOS, Aqua+Terra, and HIMAWARI-8)
        GLOBE-GO-SC                      (sky conditions only from GLOBE Observer)

    TYPE is the type of figure.  Examples:
        bar               (non-histogram)
        coincidence       (pseudo-2D histogram)
        heatmap
        histogram
        pie
        scattermap
        schematic
        timeseries

    DESCRIPTION is a short sequence of keywords describing the figure generally.  Examples:
        flag-frequency
        cloud-cover-vs-resolution
        cloud-cover

    LONG_DESCRIPTION is a more complete description of the figure.  Examples (corresponding to the DESCRIPTION
    examples):
        Frequency of quality control flags
        Distribution of cloud cover at various rebinned resolutions
        Cloud cover for all observations matched with GOES-16 and either Aqua or Terra (162 observations)
